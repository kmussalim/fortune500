## Analysis of Fortune 500 companies

In this project I analyse the largest 500 companies in USA. 

The dataset is taken from the webpage of Fortune: https://fortune.com/fortune500/.

The following data was used for analysis: rank, revenues, profits, assets, market cap, number of employees, sector, headquarters locations and others. 

The main library used for analysis is Plotly.
